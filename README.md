# Reddit_Sentiment

This project will explore user sentiments as it relates to climate change

Issues

Data Connection

[] set up API to website

[] figure out 'sentiments'/categorize data using lists that correspond to different feelings or attitudes and create binary columns indicating sentiments

[] determine limitations of dataset in terms of subreddits used. Make summary statistics to compare relative frequency and variation among and within subreddits.

[] incorporate a method to interpret different emojis as sentiments or exclude completely. Determine after checking sentiment categories with and without emojis

[] consider how we can handle sarcasm and other ways that users' actual feelings may not correspond to the words within each sentiment list. Brainstorm a list of ways they could impact accuracy, possible solutions, and desired end state 

[] Find another data source that is updated daily which can be used with this dataset.

Visualizations

[] determine types of visualizations. Compare frequency map against word clouds and display the "sentiment" to the user to show how the data is being parsed.

[] incorporate mouse-over interaction 

[] add filters by subreddit/sentiment (will this be different than groupby?)
