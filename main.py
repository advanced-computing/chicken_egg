        - **Positive correlation:** Cal-Maineâ€™s stock prices show a positive correlation with egg prices and bird flu incidents.
        - **Mixed effect on cage free chickens:** Vital Farm's profits took a big hit during the first outbreak in 2022, but saw huge increases in 2024
        - **Low effect on egg substitutes:** Post Holdings does not have a strong correlation with egg prices, but they did increase substantially post 2023 
        - **Lag Effect:** There seems to be a negligable lag between bird flu outbreaks and the subsequent rise in egg prices.
        - **Geospatial Concentration:** The highest losses in poultry (gross number) have been recorded in **California, Oregon, and Utah**, indicating these states face a higher risk of cross infection.
        - ** Regional Concentration:** There is one big center of infections near the intersection of **Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Wisconsin**
